# Gorf Disassembly (coin-op arcade game)

Disassembly of Gorf coin-op arcade game - version 2 ROMs

This disassembly was started by me a LONG time ago and has morphed over the years. There is much to write in this README file but it will have to wait as I have other obligations at the moment.
This code will assemble and run with the correct checksums.

This README.md file will be updated with more details later.
